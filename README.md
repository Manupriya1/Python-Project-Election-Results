## Election Audit with Python

## Overview of Project
I used Python to analyze election data of U.S. congressional precint in Colorado. I used prescarpped dataset to find:
- The total number of votes
- The total number of votes per candidate
- The Percentage of votes per candidate
- The Winner candidate
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
 - How many votes were cast in this congressional election : **369,711**
 
 - The breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct: 
       **- Jefferson : 10.5% (38,855)**
        **- Denver : 82.8% (306,055)** 
        **- Arapahoe : 6.7% (24,801)**

- The county with the largest number of votes: **Denver**

- The breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received:
       **- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)**
        **- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
        **- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)**
        
- The winner candidate:  **Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)**

## Election-Audit Summary: 
Using Python is a very efficient way of analysing big data like election data.  The current script can be used for any congressional elections. The script can be further modified to find out 
 - Whether there are more males or females voters:  using "for loop" and "if statement"
 - Whether people prefer mail in, in person or online voting: using "for loop" and "if statement"
